    // Tower of Hanoi
    // There are three towers. The objective of the game is to move all the disks over to tower #3, but you can't place a larger disk onto a smaller disk. To play the game or learn more about the Tower of Hanoi, check the Resources tab.

    // Tower of Hanoi

    // Create a function that takes a number discs as an argument and returns the minimum amount of steps needed to complete the game.

    // Examples
    // towerHanoi(3) ➞ 7

    // towerHanoi(5) ➞ 31

    // towerHanoi(0) ➞ 0
    // Notes
    // The amount of discs is always a positive integer.
    // 1 disc can be changed per move.

    const towerHanoi = (diskNUmber) => {
      return 2**diskNUmber - 1;
    }

    console.log(towerHanoi(3));
    console.log(towerHanoi(5));
    console.log(towerHanoi(0));
    console.log(towerHanoi(7));
    console.log(towerHanoi(21));
